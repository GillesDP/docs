Plugins are extensions that allow you to add certain functionality to your site. Plugins can bring new fragments, add code to your site, or provide CMS information.

# Install Plugin
To install a plugin, navigate to the **"Plugins"** tab in your project settings. Several plugins are available here, and more are added on a regular basis. Click on a plugin to view more information about it, and press the toggle button in the top right to activate or deactivate it.

When activating a plugin, you may be prompted to provide additional information. For instance, the Tebex plugin requires you to enter your Public API key, so it can fetch data from your Tebex store (i.e. CMS data).

# Available Plugins
We have a variety of plugins available. Some of them require additional documentation which you can find here.
