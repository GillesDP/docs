Having a frequently asked question section can help your customers find answers to common questions quickly. This can help reduce the number of support tickets you receive and improve customer satisfaction. Furthermore, if done right, it greatly improves your overall SEO score. People will be more likely to find your website if you have a FAQ section that answers their questions.
