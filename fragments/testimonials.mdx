Testimonials (or reviews) are essential to your store's success. People typically follow the herd. In fact, only a *very* small portion of the population wants to be the first to purchase a product. By showcasing what others have to say about your products, you can increase your conversion rate. This fragment allows you to display a list of testimonials on your website. Each testimonial has a name (along with a profile image), a subtitle, a rating, and a comment.
