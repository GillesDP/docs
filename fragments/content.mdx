The content fragment can be used for multiple purposes. You can use it as a section divider with just a title and subtitle, or you can use it as a full-blown content section with a title, subtitle, and description. The content fragment can be aligned to the left, center, or right. As with many other fragments, you can put the content inside a container as well.
