## What is Fragmentor?
Fragmentor is a **web-based storefront builder** allowing anyone to create a website using carefully crafted fragments. Fragments are small, self-contained pieces of content that can be combined to create a stunning websites. By **leveraging Headless APIs of e-commerce providers**, such as [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/), Fragmentor can be used to create storefronts.

In simple terms, you provide us with the Headless API token of your e-commerce provider and we provide you with a drag-and-drop editor to create a frontend for your webstore.
