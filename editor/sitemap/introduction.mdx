At the very top of the editor, there is a horizontal section that contains the project name, the option to navigate between pages, and the option to publish your project. In this guide, we'll focus on creating pages and templates.

When you click on the **"Plus"** icon, a popup will be shown giving you the option to create either a template or a (custom) page.

1. **Template** — A template is a collection of fragments that are used across many different pages. That is, a template defines a layout that is shared across many pages.
2. **Page** — A page is a collection of fragments that are unique to that page.

When you create a new project, you will have a home page by default. The home page will always be displayed first and cannot be removed. 

Now, there is a subtle difference between creating pages and templates.
