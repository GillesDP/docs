Next to the home page, you can create other custom pages as well. Popular use cases are an "About Us" page, a "Contact" page, or a "Terms of Service" page, but you can create a page for anything really.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Page">
    <p>Click on the **"Plus"** icon in the top bar of the editor and select **"Category"**.</p>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/sitemap/create.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Page">
    <p>Navigate to the newly created "Custom" page. You can now drag and drop fragments from the sidebar onto the main view to design your custom page. Each of these fragments can be configured as you wish.</p>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/sitemap/edit-page.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Page Settings">
    <p>Now onto the *most important* setting panel. Right above the list of fragments you have added to the page is a button called **"Page Settings"**.</p>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/sitemap/edit-page-settings.png" />
    </Frame>
    <p>Below is an example of the available page settings. Please take your time to fill this out properly (for every pages). It is absolutely essential to rank high on Google.</p>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/sitemap/edit-page-settings-example.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

It's a wrap! You now know all the essentials to build your first custom page.

### Bonus
Did you know you can copy fragments between pages? Simply click the **"Copy"** icon on the fragment you want to copy, and select the pages you want to copy your fragment to. This can be a real time-saver when you have multiple pages with similar content.
