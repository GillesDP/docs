title: Fragments

Fragments are reusable components that can be added to pages or templates. Some fragments act as sections, they can be added on a page or template directly. Other fragments are children of those sections, and cannot be added directly but have to exist within another fragment. 

# Insert Fragment
In order to insert or add a fragment to a page or template, click the **"+"** icon in the sidebar. A list of available (section) fragments will appear. Depending on the plugins you have installed, you may see several more fragments. 

You can use the search bar to quickly find a specific fragment. Once you have found the fragment you would like to add, simply drag and drop it into the main area of the editor. You can also click on the fragment to add it to the bottom of the page/template.

# Edit Fragment

### Fragment Theme
It is possible to apply a theme to a section fragment. When such a fragment is selected, the sidebar will show a **"Theme"** dropdown, from which you can select any of the themes you created. More information about themes can be found [here](/editor/themes).

### Fragment Background
Some fragments allow you to set a background. When such a fragment is selected, the sidebar will show a **"Background"** section. You can choose between a solid color, a gradient, or an image background.

### Fragment Layouts
Fragments can have different layouts. When clicking on a fragment, the sidebar will display the available layouts. You can switch between layouts by clicking on one of the layout thumbnails. The fragment will automatically update to reflect the new layout.

Interestingly, your content will not be deleted when you switch layouts. This allows you to quickly experiment with different layouts without having to redo all the work.

### Fragment Properties
Fragments consist of properties that can be edited. Editing those properties has never been easier. Simply hover over the fragment and look for outlines indicating a property. By clicking on the property, you can edit its value. Some properties can even be deleted by pressing the **"Backspace"** or **"Delete"** key on your keyboard.

A list of available fragment properties:
- **Text** — Text properties are modified by clicking on them. Some fields allow for rich text editing, while others require plain text only.
- **Number** — Number properties are modified by clicking on the **"ruler"** icon in the right corner of a fragment.
- **Link** — Link properties are modified by clicking on the **"link"** icon in the right corner of a fragment. You can link to internal pages or external URLs.
- **Media (Image/Video)** — Media properties are modified by clicking on them.
- **Icon** — Icon properties are modified by clicking on them.
- **Fragment** — Fragment properties are modified by clicking on them.
- **Fragment List** — Fragment list properties are modified by clicking on them. They allow you to add multiple fragments of the same type (or different types).
- **Data** — Data properties are modified by clicking on the **"data"** icon in the right corner of a fragment. The selected data source will be used to populate the fragment with data.

Some fragments may have a **"refresh"** icon in the left corner. This button indicates that the fragment can be replaced by another fragment and allow you to be more flexible when designing your site.

In most cases, it is possible to change the order of a fragment. This can be done by clicking one of the **"up"** or **"down"** arrows when a fragment is selected. This is especially helpful to move section fragments up and down the page, or move fragments inside a Fragment List.

# Copy fragment
You may find yourself in a situation where you want to copy a fragment and paste it in another location. Copying a fragment is as simple as selecting the fragment, and using the well-known key combination **Ctrl + C** (or **Cmd + C** on Mac). You can then paste the fragment using **Ctrl + V** (or **Cmd + V** on Mac) in another location.

In case you want fragments to stay in sync (i.e. when you edit one fragment, the other fragment updates automatically), please refer to [templates](/editor/templates).

# Delete fragment
To delete a fragment, you can click the **"trash"** icon in the sidebar. Alternatively, you can select the fragment and press the **"Delete"** or **"Backspace"** key on your keyboard.
