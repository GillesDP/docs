Templates are a powerful way to create reusable page structures. They allow you to define a layout and set of fragments that can be applied to multiple pages, ensuring consistency across your site and saving time when creating new pages. 

Fragments that are part of a template are synchronized across pages using that template. This means that if you update a fragment in the template, all pages using that template will automatically reflect those changes.


# Create Template
To create a new template, navigate to the **"Templates"** tab in the editor and click on the **"layout"** button in the sidebar. You will be shown a list of templates you have already created (if any). Click on the **"+"** button to create a new template.


# Edit Template
Click any of the templates you created to start editing. When a template is selected, you notice a **"Placeholder"** box in your canvas. The placeholder indicates where the actual page content will be rendered. 

You can add fragments above the placeholder, or below it. Fragments above the placeholder will render above your page content, and fragments below the placeholder will render below your page content.


# Assign Template
In order to actually use a template, you need to assign it to a page. This can be done through your page's settings. By default, pages do not use any template.

Remember that one template can be used on multiple pages. They are often used for [CMS pages](/editor/cms-pages), but they can also be used to synchronize your navigation and footer across multiple static pages.


# Delete Template
To delete a template, select the template and click the **"trash"** icon in the sidebar. Please note that deleting a template does not delete any pages that were using that template. Those pages will simply no longer be linked to the template you deleted.
