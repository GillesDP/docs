Whenever you create a new project, you will be redirected to the editor. The editor is where you will spend most of your time creating your storefront. The editor is divided into three main sections. You have the topbar which contains the project name, the option to navigate between pages and the option to publish your project. The sidebar contains all the fragments you can use to build your storefront. The main area is where you will drag and drop fragments into.

The place where you can configure your project, e.g. edit the name, connect a different e-commerce platform, update the logo, link a domain name, manage your subscription, etc.

Navigation items without a dropdown icon are pages. Clicking on a page will display the fragments that are on that page. The home page is always displayed first and cannot be removed.

This button can be used to create a new page or template.
