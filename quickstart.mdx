In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a new storefront in just a few minutes. We'll assume you have already created an account and are logged in.

## Creating a Project
You will first need to create a new project. To do this, click on the **"Create Project"** button in the top right corner of the dashboard. You'll be prompted to enter a name for your project and connect an e-commerce platform. At the time of writing, we only support [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/). Enter your Public API token and click **"Connect"**. Once connected, hit **"Create"** and a project will be created for you and you will be redirected to the editor.

<Warning>
  It is extremely important to carefully follow the instructions when connecting your e-commerce platform. Failure to do so may result in your project not working as expected. 
</Warning>
